  <h1>The New Brooklyn Nets!</h1>
  
  <h2>Also my... first... website!</h2>
<h2>I'm ligit out of my mind!</h2>
  <h2>By the way...</h2>
  <img id="Kick" src= "funny-basketball.jpg" >
<h2>Also let's go WARRIORS!</h2>
<h4> Though almost everyone on the 2019 warriors left, they should be okay with Steph and Klay... I think they're gonna have D'angelo Russel and Willie Cauly Stein! And one more person which I think is Glenn Robinson III to take the small foward.</h4>
  <h4>The starting lineup for the warriors might be Steph Curry for point, D'Angelo Russel for shooting until Klay Thompson comes back, Glenn Robinson III for small foward, Draymond Green for power, and finally Willie Cauley Stein for center. There you have it! The starting 5 for the warriors. Still seems like an unstoppable team to me.</h4>
  <h2> And more breaking news... (Actually awesome news)</h2>
  <h2>The Brooklyn NETS are gonna have Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and... Deandre Jordon!</h2>
  <h4>They're going to dominate! Like that time with Jason Kidd!</h4>
<h3>Here is a picture of the possible future to happen. They look good in those jerseys.</h3>

  <h3>Also, get well KD!</h3> 
  
  
    <h5>Hope you had a good time in the Bay!</h5>
    <h5>We will miss you!</h5>
  
    <h6> Too bad the warriors didn't get the 3peat. Might be the last championship for the Warriors for a while... Now that they're new better teams coming to next years NBA. </h6>
    <h5>The Raptors were real lucky.</h5>
    <h5>Especially during that time against the sixers! I was kind've rooting for them!</h5>
    <h5>But, now I'm rooting for the Nets! I wonder how it will be like with 3 pro basketball players that never played together. They're even my favorite players!I heard that Durant wanted to play with Kyrie when he had a better deal with the warriors for 5 years! Kyrie and Durant would've dominated, but with Jordan... Whoo I'm pumped!</h5>
    <h5>I just feel real bad with Durant's ruptured right achilles tendon. He won't be able to play the Next season! Now it will be Kyrie and Jordan. They should make it into the playoffs!</h5>
  <h5>This also reminded me when I once read about a girl who trains everyday and is aiming to become the first woman NBA player! I've got to admit that's pretty cool.</h5>
  <h5>Anyway, </h5>

<h4>Another thing to mention and that is video games are getting widly popular and I found a game that is free and fun to play that may take you interest.</h4>
  <h3> This game is similar to Super Smash Bros.</h3>
 
<a href="https://www.mcleodgaming.com/games/ssf2"> AND here it is a link to Super Smash Flash 2!</a><p></p>

    <h4>Remember Super Smash Flash 2 is a free game to play and is kind've like Super Smash bros. Only on computer! Not sure about the smart phone.</h4>

    <h3>The character select probably changes from time to time though I am not sure.</h3>
  <h3> This is an example of the character list.</h3>

  <h4> Meta Knight is my favorite character in the game. Though the strongest one in the game is Captain Falcon. He may not look like much, but he's hella strong and fast.</h4>
  <h3> Give a shoutout to McLeodGaming for making the game and... well hope you like it!</h3>
    
    <h3>That's all I have about the NEW Brooklyn Nets and the 2019 NBA Championship...</h3>
  <h3>Oh wait we also covered gaming popularity!</h3>
<h2>But! I am pumped for next years NBA! And the years to come! Who wouldn't be?!</h2>
